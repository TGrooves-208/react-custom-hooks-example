# React Custom Hook Example
Custom hooks come in handy when addressing redundancy within a project
With this example you can see the comments in the `App.js` file that goes over the logic
Things to consider before createing custom hooks are:
- Is there redundancy that exists with the implementation 
- Can a custom hook address this
- Creating a custom hook is in essence a helper function that starts with `useCustomHook`
- The linting allows for the same convention to be used and is considered the correct standard to follow
